change all the functions to be used by computer and not player


Define the inputs : provide board + current player -> that will be the first layer then let the network do magic
    Does the code not add extra layers ? en fait si 
    next step is to really modify the network

Define the possible actions : tree with every possible move -> alpha beta search min max
    create a tree with every board or evaluation
    create a "match" function



Define the fit function : not sure i need it ? make computer compete with each others
    that's what i need to do now, c'est la merde
